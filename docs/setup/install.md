# Installing Arnie
We recommend installing `arnie` as a package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/arnie/) via pip.
```
pip install arnie
```

You can also use pip to install arnie directly from our Github repo:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/DasLab/arnie
```

## Installing via Github
Alternatively, the `arnie` package source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/DasLab/arnie). You can install via source code as below.

```
git clone https://github.com/DasLab/arnie.git
```

Note that if you install via the Github Repo, you will need to add the path to arnie to your PYTHONPATH (for example, in your .bashrc as `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/arnie`).
